# HANSE
Halcys Ansi Editor

Currently it doesn't do very much, but you can load .ans files, save .ans files, export to PNG and do some basic drawing (with the keyboard) and editing (internal copy-paste works).

The Ansi(Whatever).py files can be used without Qt or any gui stuff whatsoever to read, write, manipulate and render .ans files.

Requires Numpy, PIL, PyQt5. Works on Linux and Windows.
